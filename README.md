> [!TIP]
> **⭐ Star this repo** to save it and get updates when new roles are added.

Instead of refreshing a dozen career pages by hand, it reads company hiring feeds directly and keeps one live list, newest roles on top, refreshed automatically throughout the day.

**🔔 New roles in your inbox:** [subscribe by email](https://heyinihere.github.io/Automated-List-Of-Summer-2027-and-Fall-2026-MechEng-Internships/#subscribe) - one email a day, only when new internships actually appeared, unsubscribe from any email in two clicks. (Prefer RSS-to-email? [Feedrabbit works too](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FHeyIniHere%2FAutomated-List-Of-Summer-2027-and-Fall-2026-MechEng-Internships%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Ffeed.xml).)

## What this is

This is an engine, not a hand-kept list. It polls company career feeds several times a day, finds the internships, removes duplicates, and rebuilds this page on its own. Every link comes straight from the source, so it's real and current, not a stale list someone forgot to update (speed matters).

## What makes this different

- **📅 [Drop Radar](#drop-radar)** - a forecast of **what's coming**: each marquee company's typical opening window, replaced by the real drop date the moment the engine catches it live. Windows are estimates and labelled as such; only dates the engine observed itself are marked verified.
- **Visa intel, computed** - 🇺🇸 / 🛂 flags detected automatically from every job description, plus ✓ for employers with a real H-1B track record (official USCIS data, FY2022-23 - a history, not a promise). The big lists crowdsource this by hand; here it's code. Most postings say nothing either way, and those are shown as unknown rather than guessed.
- **A date on nearly every role** - taken from the job portal itself where the portal states one, so newest-first actually means newest. The exact coverage figure is printed at the bottom of this page every run.
- **Skill tags + pay, extracted** - every posting's text is scanned for the stack it wants (Python, C++, PyTorch, ...) and the pay it states - searchable on the [dashboard](https://heyinihere.github.io/Automated-List-Of-Summer-2027-and-Fall-2026-MechEng-Internships/), included in the CSV and API.
- **Alerts your way** - [email digests](https://heyinihere.github.io/Automated-List-Of-Summer-2027-and-Fall-2026-MechEng-Internships/#subscribe) or [RSS](https://heyinihere.github.io/Automated-List-Of-Summer-2027-and-Fall-2026-MechEng-Internships/feed.xml) (point any reader, or a Slack/Discord RSS integration, at it) - plus a [live dashboard](https://heyinihere.github.io/Automated-List-Of-Summer-2027-and-Fall-2026-MechEng-Internships/) with search, filters, and a saved-roles list that never leaves your browser.
- **An engine, not a spreadsheet** - 3,962 job-board endpoints (3,870 distinct employers; some run more than one board) polled every hour across 12 ATS platforms, full source and tests in this repo.

## Scope

| | |
|---|---|
| **Roles** | Software Engineering, Data Science & Machine Learning (and closely related technical internships) |
| **Region** | United States |
| **Cycles** | Summer 2027 and Fall 2026 |

## About

I'm an international student studying in the United States, so I built this for the search I'm doing myself. The list is US roles only for now - that's where I'm searching. Use it to spot roles early and apply before they fill up - being first genuinely helps.

## Where this is going

I'm building this in the open and adding to it as it grows. Recently shipped: **email alerts**, the **Drop Radar**, **auto-detected sponsorship flags**, and the **live dashboard**. Next up: personalized alerts (pick your categories), per-company hiring pages, and a ghost-posting detector. If it helps you, a star means a lot and tells me to keep going.

## How to use

<details>
<summary><b>Reading the table — flags, dates, and the cycle split</b> (click to expand)</summary>

- Roles are grouped by cycle below - **newest posting on top, oldest at the bottom.**
- A cycle section holds only roles whose **employer stated that cycle** - in the title, or in the posting's own text. Postings that name no cycle anywhere are in *Recently posted — cycle not stated* further down, with **no cycle guessed for them**. Same quality bar, different amount of evidence.
- The **Posted** column is the date the company published the role.
- **Flags:** 🇺🇸 = requires U.S. citizenship or a security clearance · 🛂 = the posting says it won't sponsor a work visa · 🏠 = the location says remote · 🆕 = spotted in the last 48 hours. Sponsorship flags are detected automatically from each job description - treat them as a strong hint and confirm on the posting.
- **✓ after a company name** = a real H-1B track record: USCIS approved 10+ petitions for that employer in FY2022–2023 (matched automatically against the official [H-1B Employer Data Hub](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub)). No ✓ doesn't mean they won't sponsor - it means we can't prove they have.
- Track your applications with [`data/internships.csv`](data/internships.csv) (opens in Excel / Google Sheets).
- Missing a company? Adding one takes a single line, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Recently posted — cycle not stated  (47 roles)

These postings never name a cycle — not in the title, not in the posting text — so neither do we. They're recent tech internships (posted within the last few weeks), often exactly the early drops worth applying to first; we just can't tell you which cycle they're for, and we'd rather say so than guess. The moment a posting's own text states a cycle, the role moves up into that section automatically.

## 📅 Drop Radar — when companies usually post for Summer 2027

Stop refreshing career pages. 🎯 = the employer's **own posted date**, read from their careers API. (We may have discovered the role after it went live — the date is the employer's, not our discovery time.) The rest are typical opening **months**, hand-checked against each company's careers page and public recruiting guides. ✅ = already live in the list above.

> **Heads up:** companies trend *earlier* every cycle, and "~Aug" is a month, not a day. Treat "expected" as when to **start watching**, and "rolling" companies as worth checking year-round.

| Company | Typical opening | Expected this cycle | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

_60 companies on the [full radar](https://heyinihere.github.io/Automated-List-Of-Summer-2027-and-Fall-2026-MechEng-Internships/#radar). **26** dated from our own live observations 🎯 (this grows every cycle). "~Aug" = hand-verified typical month, not a promise of the day; "rolling" = posts year-round; "waiting" = not seen in our tracked feeds yet, not a guarantee it isn't out somewhere else._

<details>
<summary><strong>Recently closed</strong> — 17 roles that left the list in the last 14 days</summary>

_Why each one left is in the last column, because the two reasons carry different evidence. **Gone from feed** = two consecutive complete reads of the employer's board no longer returned it (strong, but not the employer telling us directly). **Out of scope** = still posted, but it no longer passes our filters — our call, not theirs. **Not recorded** = closed before we started tracking the reason._

## Hiring timeline

Internships posted per week, from each role's real published date - redrawn automatically on every run. When this line takes off, recruiting season is open:

  <img alt="Internships posted per week, drawn from real published dates" src="docs/trends-light.svg">

## How it stays current

A small Python engine reads public company hiring feeds directly, keeps the roles that match the scope above, de-duplicates across sources, records each role's published date once (so it never shifts), and regenerates this page through GitHub Actions. It polls every company concurrently (async) with retry/backoff and per-host rate limits. The full source is in this repo.

_Engine (last run): 3,727 of 3,962 registered boards returned successfully across 12 ATS platforms (99% of boards attempted, 94% of the full registry) · completed in 508.4s · 108 board(s) returned a capped result set, so their roles were not eligible to be closed this run · employer or source-derived date on 100% of open roles._

## How this list is built

[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) documents exactly what every label claims — what separates a stated cycle from an inferred one, what the ✓ H-1B badge does and doesn't mean, how a role gets closed, and which limitations are known. Anything on this page that doesn't match the code is a bug worth reporting.

## Contributing

Adding a company takes one line, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), or just [open a request](../../issues/new?template=add-company.yml) with the board URL. **Spotted something wrong?** [Report the exact field](../../issues/new?template=wrong-data.yml) — wrong country, wrong cycle, closed role, bad sponsorship flag. Those reports usually fix a rule, which fixes every other role too.

Also here: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) (what the email list stores — an address and nothing else) · [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) · [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [MIT licensed](LICENSE).

Built by one student with AI assistance, in the open. The part that matters isn't who typed it — it's that the rules, the tests, and every run's output are all public and checkable.

## Note on dates

The **Posted** column shows when a role was published, with the newest at the top. I pull the posting date straight from each job portal, but a lot of them don't expose one publicly, so those rows show a dash (—) for now instead of a guessed date. The ones that do publish a date are dated. Know the real date for a dashed role? Open a PR and I'll merge it.

Roles can close at any time, so always confirm on the company's own site before applying.
